        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> I am a dedicated researcher in the field of psychology, with a strong focus on health-related behaviors and psychological disorders. My work aims to understand the causes, effects, and treatments of various mental health conditions, contributing to the development of effective strategies for improving well-being.  

With a Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from the University of Rajshahi, I have actively engaged in research across multiple institutions. I have over three years of experience as a Research Assistant, participating in projects that involve systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and data-driven studies on topics such as adolescent obesity, mental health, and behavioral psychology.  

Beyond research, I have nearly two years of teaching experience as the Head of Biology at Focus University Admission Coaching. Additionally, I have published multiple research articles and actively contribute to academic discussions through conferences and seminars. My technical proficiency in research software (SPSS, NVivo, Mendeley) and strong analytical skills further enhance my contributions to the field.  

I am passionate about advancing psychological research through collaboration and innovative methodologies. My goal is to continue exploring critical mental health issues and contribute to evidence-based solutions that positively impact society.
